## NuGet package

**This project already has the AltDriver inside, but otherwise would require to add https://www.nuget.org/packages/AltTester-Driver package in order to work.**

### Running the tests on Windows or MacOS
The tests are meant to be run on an Windows or MacOS device.
Create a folder `App` under project.

To start the tests, depending of your OS run:

- `./start_tests_Mac.sh` on MacOS/Linux

    Create a folder `TrashCatMac` under `App`.
    The app is provided at https://altom.com/app/uploads/AltTester/TrashCat/TrashCatMacOS.app.zip and needs to be included unzipped under the App/TrashCatMac/ folder.

- `./start_tests_Windows.sh` on Windows

    Create a folder `TrashCatWindows` under `App`.
    The app is provided at https://altom.com/app/uploads/AltTester/TrashCat/TrashCatWindows.zip and needs to be included unzipped under the App/TrashCatWindows/ folder.
    
This script will:

- start the app on your device
- run the tests
- stop the app after the test are done
